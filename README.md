# The Music Room


TO DO: The focus of this project is to collaboratively research, experiment with and
ultimately design and build a multimedia application using design and motion tools
as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your team will implement drag and drop
functionality to load audio clips and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger
animation, and play a compiled audio track

## Installation


TO DO: From the github link https://github.com/Kahani22/gajjar_victor_musicmixer clone the folder structure to access the webpage which consists of a music room.

## Usage

TO DO: The Music Room is a website with a dynamic visual and audio experience. The Room consists of several objects such as clock, chair, guitar, etc. which are placed in a manner that it gives a visual of a room. Each object in a room has its own audio. Which when dragged on to the compose sheet (with null sound) creates dynamic music according to the series of objects dropped into it. Each time user replays with a different sequence of objects it gives a different experience than the previous one. The website is made more interactive by various transitions and hover over effects.
